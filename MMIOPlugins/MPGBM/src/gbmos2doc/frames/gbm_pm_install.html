<body>

<h1 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">GBM PM-Tools Installation</h1>

<p>
The following chapters describe the installation procedure for
the GBM PM-Tools on OS/2 and eComStation.
</p>

<p>
All applications included in this package require a version of GBM.DLL
higher than version 1.11. Recommended is GBM.DLL 1.35 or higher.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the applications you want to use, copy the following
files into an empty directory. For the PM applications GBMV and GBMV2
German and English versions are available.
</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>GBMV:</b><p>Required files: <code>gbmv.exe</code>, <code>gbm.dll</code></p>
 </li>

 <li><b>GBMV2:</b><p>Required files: <code>gbmv2.exe</code> , <code>gbmv2.hlp</code>,
                                     <code>gbmdlg.dll</code>, <code>gbmdlg.hlp</code>,
                                     <code>gbm.dll</code></p>
 </li>

 <li><b>GBMDLG:</b><p>Required files: <code>gbmdlg.dll</code>, <code>gbmdlg.hlp</code><br>
                      Developers who want to use it in their own programs need
                      additionally <code>gbm.h</code>, <code>gbmdlg.h</code>, <code>gbmdlg.lib</code>.</p>
 </li>

 <li><b>GBMLOGO:</b><p>Required files: <code>gbmlogo.exe</code>, <code>gbm.dll</code></p>
 </li>

 <li><b>GBMVFSA:</b><p>Required files: <code>gbmvfsa.exe</code>, <code>gbm.dll</code></p>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
There is a REXX script included (gbmwpobj.cmd) that creates desktop
icons for <b>GBMV</b> and <b>GBMV2</b>. Simply copy it to their installation directory
and run it.
</p>
<br>

<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Accessing all tools from everywhere</h2>

<p>GBM.DLL can be installed at a central location of the system so that
it is found in the paths defined by LIBPATH in CONFIG.SYS. Thus sharing
between all programs of this package and the programs from the gbmos2
(the command line tools) package is possible.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: red;">
If you're using eComStation 1.2 or 1.2R please read the special notes for
installing GBM to this system <a href="gbm_tools_install.html">here</a>.
</span>
</p>

<b>Note:</b>
<p>
 If gbmv.exe and gbmv2.exe should be run from <b>everywhere</b> on the command line
 or a different <b>work directory in the WPS program object</b> than the program
 installation directory should be used, it is necessary to add the installation
 directory to some environment variables in CONFIG.SYS.
</p>
<p>The following changes are necessary:
   (It is assumed that the installation directory is D:\GBM)
</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>Add D:\GBM to the end of the line beginning with SET PATH separated
      by ; to the previous parameter.<br>
      (e.g. <code>SET PATH=C:\OS2;D:\GBM</code>)</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Add D:\GBM to the end of the line beginning with SET HELP separated
      by ; to the previous parameter.  This is necessary so that the system
      can find GBMV2.HLP and GBMDLG.HLP.<br>
      (e.g. <code>SET HELP=C:\OS2\HELP;D:\GBM</code>)</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Add D:\GBM to the end of the line beginning with LIBPATH separated
   by ; to the previous parameter. This is necessary so that the system
   can find GBM.DLL and GBMDLG.DLL.<br>
   (e.g. <code>LIBPATH=.;C:\OS2\DLL;D:\GBM)</code></p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Reboot.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>For this step you need gbmver.exe. It is included in the GBM base
      package only, which you have already as you have GBM.DLL. Copy it
      into the installation directory if it's not already there.<br><br>

      Open a command line and go to a directory OTHER THAN the installation.
      Then start gbmver.exe as if it would be in this directory.
      It should report the location and the version of GBM.DLL as well
      as the location of GBMDLG.DLL (GBM File Dialog).
      Verify that the reported files are the installed versions. If the
      reported files are found in a different path, do a file search
      for GBM.DLL or GBMDLG.DLL on your system and check for duplicates
      or older versions.<br><br>

      If an older version of GBM.DLL is found (version must be higher than 1.11 !!!),
      you can replace it with the GBM.DLL from the GBM base package.
      Alternatively modify the LIBPATH statement in CONFIG.SYS so that
      the correct path to GBM.DLL and GBMDLG.DLL is placed before all other
      versions. After the changes are done, check again with gbmver.exe.</p>
