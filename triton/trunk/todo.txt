Triton - ToDo
-------------

AudioMixer:
- Test what happens if a zero length buffer is given into the AudMix system!
- Reverse playback!

- Remove restriction of source audio format (handle non-16bits-44KHz-stereo)
- Remove restriction of destination audio format
- Use MMX instructions for saturation and at other places

MMIO:
- Create documentations:
  - How to compile (dependencies, etc...)
  - Docs for users (Using MMIO)
  - Docs for plugin developers (Extending MMIO)
- Create OGG Vorbis plugins (OGG  demuxer, Vorbis decoder)
- Create a video decoder plugin (possibly DivX?)
- Create a video output plugin
- Check what happens if the libavcodec-based plugin is loaded and used twice at
  the same time in one process, because it has statics and frees them!
- Modify GBM-based image decoder plugin to use the GBM symbols dynamically
  instead of simple dynamic linking, because the VAC Open Class libraries also
  use GBM and this may result in symbol collision in WPS processes (and who
  knows where else).
