<h1 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">GBM plugin for Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox/SeaMonkey</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Introduction<br></h2>

<p>
This is a plugin for the Webbrowsers Netscape, Mozilla, Firefox and
SeaMonkey available for OS/2 and eComStation that extends them with
the support of reading all bitmap formats supported by GBM.DLL.
</p>
<p>
For being able to use it, the following additional files are required:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Netscape, Mozilla, Firefox or SeaMonkey<br>
      The plugin has been tested with Firefox 1.5.0.5, SeaMonkey 1.0.3,
      Netscape 4.61 and even Netscape 2.02 but it should work with other versions as well.
      Printing is only supported on Mozilla/Firefox/SeaMonkey.
  </li>
  <li>GBM.DLL (GBM Bitmap Format Handler) version 1.35 or higher except 1.41</li>
  <li>Optionally GBMDLG.DLL (GBM File Dialog)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>GBM.DLL version 1.41 must not be used as it contains a compiler
optimization issue that reduces stability. When used together
with the GBM plugin, the browser might crash when opening bitmaps.
Please upgrade to GBM.DLL version 1.42 or higher.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>This plugin requires so far that the browser cache is enabled.
Further version might be able to directly stream the images into
the system memory.
</p>
<br>

<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Supported features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>popup menu</li>
  <li>transformations mirror</li>
  <li>multipage navigation</li>
  <li>bitmap format info dialog</li>
  <li>save the shown page to any GBM supported bitmap file format</li>
  <li>uses GBM File Dialog if found, otherwise OS/2 File Dialog is used</li>
  <li>printing of embedded bitmaps is supported on Mozilla/Firefox/SeaMonkey</li>
  <li>English and German localized with autodetection via LANG variable</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Installing GBM for Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox/SeaMonkey</h2>

<p>Simply copy <code>npgbm.dll</code> into the plugin directory of your browser.
Please check the requirements listed for <code>gbm.dll</code> above.
Copy <code>gbm.dll</code> to a directory somewhere in your LIBPATH (defined in CONFIG.SYS).
</p>
<p>
The plugin will try to use the GBM File Dialog if it is found somewhere
in the LIBPATH. If it is not found, the standard OS/2 file dialog will be
used. Save options for bitmap export cannot be specified in the OS/2 file dialog
and thus the plugin will use the default export options of each bitmap format.
</p>
<p>
<b>Testing the plugin:</b><br>
You can test the correct installation of the GBM plugin with the links
provided below. You need at least GBM.DLL version 1.42. Only then the PNM
images will be shown.
