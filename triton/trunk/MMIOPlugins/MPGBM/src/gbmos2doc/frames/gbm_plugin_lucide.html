  <title>Heiko's Homepage - GBM plugin for Lucide</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1 style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">GBM plugin for Lucide</h1>
<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Introduction<br></h2>

<p>Lucide is a general purpose document viewer for eComStation. It provides
a plugin interface which allows developers to integrate support for all kinds
of document files. For details about Lucide please visit the
<a href="http://svn.netlabs.org/lucide" target="_blank">Lucide project homepage</a>.
</p>
<p>
Please note that Lucide is still in beta status and thus also the GBM plugin
might not work in all cases as expected.
</p>
<p>
The GBM plugin for Lucide is such an extension that provides access to all GBM
supported bitmap formats. The following Lucide features are currently supported by the plugin:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read all bitmap formats supported by GBM.DLL</li>
  <li>Save loaded bitmap in any GBM supported format if it has only one page (requires Lucide beta 2.1)</li>
  <li>Multipage bitmap files which can be navigated in Lucide</li>
  <li>Scaled bitmap preview</li>
  <li>Rotated bitmap preview</li>
  <li>Document information</li>
</ul>

<p>
For being able to use it, the following additional files are required:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lucide beta 2 or higher</li>
  <li>GBM.DLL (GBM Bitmap Format Handler) version 1.35 or higher except 1.41<br>
      (versions below will work but then only the first page within
      a multipage file is shown)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br>GBM.DLL version 1.41 must not be used as it contains a compiler
optimization issue that reduces stability. When used together
with the GBM plugin for Lucide, Lucide will crash when opening
JPEG bitmaps. Please upgrade to GBM.DLL version 1.42 or higher.
</p>
<br>

<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Installing GBM for Lucide</h2>

<p>Simply copy <code>lugbm.dll</code> into the Lucide installation directory.
Please check the requirements listed for <code>gbm.dll</code> above.
Copy <code>gbm.dll</code> either into the Lucide installation directory beside
<code>lugbm.dll</code> or put it somewhere in your LIBPATH (defined in CONFIG.SYS).
The last option is recommended if <code>gbm.dll</code> is also required by
other programs.
</p>
