<p>The original version of GBM and the GBM tools for PM was written by
Andy Key which he wrote in his own time on his own equipment.
He used public non-confidential information to do so.
He placed all this code into the public domain.</p>
<p>
I (Heiko Nitzsche) have added code to GBM and the GBM tools under
the same conditions and place all my donated code into the public domain
as well. This does not apply to the used <a href="#JPEG">JPEG</a>,
<a href="#PNG">PNG</a> and <a href="#TIFF">TIFF</a> helper libraries
as well as to <a href="#GBMLUCIDE">GBM plug-in for Lucide</a> and
<a href="#GBMMOZILLA">GBM plug-in for Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox/SeaMonkey</a>.
</p>
<b>These libraries have their own license.</b>
<p>
The tools GBMVER, GBMCONV, the libraries GBMRX, GBMDLGRX, the GBM plugin
for Lucide and the GBM plugin for Netscape/Mozilla/Firefox/SeaMonkey have
been entirely written by me (Heiko Nitzsche).
I used public non-confidential information.
</p>
<p>
The source code of all GBM tools and libraries is freely available
as well. The main goal is to support developers in creating new or enhancing existing
applications for the OS/2 and eComStation platform.
As the source code is placed into the Public Domain except for the above
mentioned libs (<a href="#JPEG">JPEG</a>, <a href="#PNG">PNG</a>, <a href="#TIFF">TIFF</a>,
<a href="#GBMLUCIDE">GBM plug-in for Lucide</a>, <a href="#GBMMOZILLA">GBM plug-in for Mozilla</a>),
this is especially targeted to non-commercial developers which cannot afford licensing costs.
Nevertheless it can of course also be used for commercial applications.
</p>

<p>Feel free to do whatever you like with it.</p>
<p>No copyright / no royalties / no guarantees / no problem. Caveat Emptor! </p>
<p>Anyone offering ideas/code must be happy with the above.</p>

<a name="GIF"></a><h3 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Compu$erve GIF Tax</h3>
<p>Both Unisys and IBM (and others) have various patents pertaining
to the LZW algorithm used in GIF and LZW compressed TIFF files.</p>
<p>For many years Unisys have only licensed their LZW technology in
hardware implementations (typically Modems). Now Unisys (through
Compu$erve) are looking to license the use of LZW in software
applications, such as GIF and TIFF. This is the infamous 'Compu$erve
GIF Tax'. </p>
<p>Unisys have stated (in news postings) that non-commercial software
need not be licensed.<br>
Assuming this to be true, GBM will continue to support GIF and LZW
compressed TIFF. </p>
<p>It is anticipated that this move will mean the death of LZW in
image files, and that the Net will develop a replacement based on
LZSS, LZ77, LZHUF, Yabba or other (hopefully) non-patented
technology. The PNG format is already available as a possible
replacement and it is supported by GBM meanwhile.<br>
</p>
<p>On 20th June 2003, US Patent 4,558,302 expired. This is the patent
that describes the use of LZW in GIF files. Therefore, from now on,
authors of commercial programs should no longer need to pay
Compu$erve / UNISYS to use GIF.<br>
